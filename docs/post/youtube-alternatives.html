<p>The following diagram ranks the top 50 websites by total average visits
worldwide monthly
[<a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/the-50-most-visited-websites-in-the-world/" class="LinkWithIcon"><img src="/asset/icon/www_visualcapitalist_com" class="icon"><span class="label">visualcapitalist</span></a>].</p>

<p>YouTube.com was the second most popular with 34.6 billion visits. This was 37.4%
as much traffic as the first most popular website -- Google.com with 92.5
billion visits -- and 135.0% as much traffic as the third most popular website
-- Facebook.com with 20 billion visits.</p>
<p>Together, YouTube and Facebook majorly dominate the market of (non-porn) public
video hosting. The only entity that even comes close is the fourth and fifth
most popular websites -- Twitter.com with 6.6 billion visits and Instagram.com
with 6.1 billion visits -- which are 19.1% and 17.6% as much traffic as just
YouTube.com respectively. Of course, Facebook.com, Twitter.com, and
Instagram.com are not only centered around video content so this comparison to
YouTube.com's domain of video hosting is only partial.</p>
<p>In the same way that Google.com has dominated search and Facebook.com has
dominated social media (debatable what "social media" means here), YouTube has
dominated public video hosting.</p>
<div class="headingWrapper"><h2 id="YouTube&#x27;s%20Revenue%20Model"><a href="http://localhost:3000/post/youtube-alternatives.html#YouTube&#x27;s%20Revenue%20Model">YouTube's Revenue Model</a></h2></div>
<p>How does YouTube make money? According to YouTube, they makes money in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Payments from advertisers in return for hosting ads on most YouTube videos</li>
<li>Payments from subscribers to YouTube Premium in return to access to exclusive
content funded by YouTube</li>
</ul>
<p>[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/howyoutubeworks/our-commitments/sharing-revenue/" class="LinkWithIcon"><img src="/asset/icon/www_youtube_com" class="icon"><span class="label">YouTube: Sharing Revenue</span></a>]</p>
<p>The vast majority of YouTube's revenue comes from advertising [citation needed].</p>
<div class="headingWrapper"><h2 id="YouTube&#x27;s%20Network%20Effects"><a href="http://localhost:3000/post/youtube-alternatives.html#YouTube&#x27;s%20Network%20Effects">YouTube's Network Effects</a></h2></div>
<p>Independent video creators (or just "creators" for short) create the vast
majority of content of YouTube. Even the YouTube Premium content is usually made
by creators that started out like anyone else and built an audience over years
of producing publically-available videos on YouTube.</p>
<p>In order for YouTube to be such a popular site, it needs to have a large amount
and variety of content that appeal strongly to many different kinds of users.
With such a huge creator base producing content, YouTube clearly meets this
demand. The network effect here is that new creators that are considering where
to publish their content are more attracted to YouTube the more users are there
to watch their content, and new users that are considering where to look for
content are more attracted to YouTube the more creators publish their content
there. This virtuous cycle results in YouTube gaining a massive advantage over
competitors, as any small starting differential in users and creators between
YouTube and competitors in the past grows much larger over time as the advantage
accumulates due to the increasing returns (as opposed to diminishing return)
aspect of network effects with respect to gaining new users and creators.</p>
<p>How could a new competitor possibly compete with YouTube with this dynamic
persisting?</p>
<div class="headingWrapper"><h2 id="Competing%20with%20YouTube"><a href="http://localhost:3000/post/youtube-alternatives.html#Competing%20with%20YouTube">Competing with YouTube</a></h2></div>
<p>To decide a measure for competativeness with YouTube, first specify respects to
which the competitor would like to compete with YouTube. This could be all
respects where the competitor is better in every way, or a selection of respects
where the competitor does not compete for all of YouTube's market but can still
gain an advantage in a submarket.</p>
<p>Some example respects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attractiveness for creators</li>
<li>Quality content</li>
<li>Curated content</li>
<li>Personalized/commissioned content</li>
<li>TODO: more respects</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these are already approved upon from YouTube by websites such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Vimeo</em>, etc. allows a creator to put their videos on sale for a chosen prices
so that users can directly buy access to individual videos.</li>
<li><em>Patreon</em>, etc. simplfies the process of a creator receiving support directly
from fans, and allows a creator to gather a personalized community and sell
commisioned content to patrons.</li>
<li><em>Netflix</em>, <em>Hulu</em>, etc. offer quality, curated, long-form content (movies and
TV shows) for a fixed subscription price with (usually) no advertisements.</li>
<li><em>Twitch</em>, etc. offer specialized livestreaming services and audience
interaction.</li>
<li>TODO: more examples</li>
</ul>
<p>Apparently, there still is some diverse competition among specific sub-markets
of public video hosting, even if YouTube dominates the most generic case and,
even combined altogether these submarkets probably do not match half of
YouTube's popularity (by average views).</p>
<p>So, is there some clear inefficiency in this state of affairs where a new
competitor <em>should</em> be able to compete with YouTube more directly? Or are there
good reasons why competition should focus on these more niche markets rather
than try to compete for YouTube's creators and users in general?</p>
<div class="headingWrapper"><h2 id="YouTube&#x27;s%20General%20Advantage"><a href="http://localhost:3000/post/youtube-alternatives.html#YouTube&#x27;s%20General%20Advantage">YouTube's General Advantage</a></h2></div>
<p>A major respect to which no public video hosting service seems to compete well
with YouTube on is sheer scale. As of February 2020, YouTube announced that
about 720 thousand hours of video are uploaded to and 1 billion hours of video
are watched on YouTube each day.
[<a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-at-15-my-personal-journey" class="LinkWithIcon"><img src="/asset/icon/blog_youtube" class="icon"><span class="label">Blog.Youtube: YouTube at 15</span></a>].
No other platform, not even Facebook, comes close to handling the size of that
data being transmitted at that rate (as of 2018, Facebook serves about 100
million hours of video content each day)
[<a href="https://www.yansmedia.com/blog/facebook-video-statistics" class="LinkWithIcon"><img src="/asset/icon/www_yansmedia_com" class="icon"><span class="label">Yansmedia: Facebook Video Statistics</span></a>].</p>
<p>Video is the highest-bandwidth media popularly consumed: they are very large
(being a long collection of images) and are consumed fast. Hosts and browsers
have even adopted special support for <em>buffering</em> specifically to allow viewing
to be possible in HTML. To facilitate such high-bandwidth hosting at such a
large scale, a provider needs to have very distributed (for robustness and
mitigating latency) and powerful infrastructure.</p>
<p>Google (which owns YouTube and sustained it when it was popularly thought that
YouTube might not have a sustainable business model
[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube" class="LinkWithIcon"><img src="/asset/icon/en_wikipedia_org" class="icon"><span class="label">Wikipedia: History of YouTube</span></a>])
has developed a huge advantange in these aspects through its array of
datacenters
[<a href="https://datacenterfrontier.com/inside-a-google-data-center-2020-version/" class="LinkWithIcon"><img src="/asset/icon/datacenterfrontier_com" class="icon"><span class="label">datacenterfrontier</span></a>].
Building these datacenters is an huge activation cost
[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_energy" class="LinkWithIcon"><img src="/asset/icon/en_wikipedia_org" class="icon"><span class="label">Wikipedia: activation energy</span></a>].
When Google bought YouTube, it kickstarted its popularity by expanding this
infrastructure in order to increase capacity, which ultimately facilitated the
increasing returns of network effects that played such a large part in building
YouTube's dominance today. Without access to Google's capital, YouTube the
start-up might not have been able to afford or judge worthwhile the risk of
investing in the infrastructure that was so important for its success.</p>
<p>Today, the activation costs are higher and lower in different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The costs of hosting content online is much lower due to better access to
third-party, business-oriented content hosting services. However, these
services are more costly on margin than owning the infrastructure yourself, so
in the long-run take a deep cut into overall profits.</li>
<li>With YouTube as an existing and hugely dominant market player, a new
competitor needs to overcome YouTube's advantages. Since YouTube is basically
free for users and creators, it is diffuclt to undercut its prices (although,
they can still be undercut by paying more to creators and even users). A
competitor would need to appeal to a submarket, as mentioned in the Competing
with YouTube section earlier.</li>
<li>It is much easier for new competition to get noticed on today's internet as
opposed to the internet of 2006 when there were many fewer users and much
worse ability to share links to content. Online advertisement is easier and
more efficient than ever.</li>
<li>TODO: more ways</li>
</ul>
<div class="headingWrapper"><h2 id="Predictions"><a href="http://localhost:3000/post/youtube-alternatives.html#Predictions">Predictions</a></h2></div>
<p>In the next 10 years, I expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Activation costs for undercutting YouTube with a generally better service are
too high and have too low expected returns to expect it to be accomplished
successfully anytime soon. YouTube will maintain a huge dominance in general
public video hosting, but its dominant share of traffic will be roughly
stable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The submarkets of public video hosting will become more prominent, and start
to eat away at YouTube's user/creator base. YouTube will still be the home for
random homemade content and newly independent creators, but a variety of other
platforms will attract away creators with features cater to their specific
kinds content. Creators can will make their start on YouTube, but usually
migrate to other platforms once they find a content niche. This will be
facilitated by a drop in the effective cost of using alternative platforms due
to an homogenizing of user interfaces and sharing methods.</p>
